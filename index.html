            This week I learned about Tinkercad and how to build different objects from
            real life. We learned about mechanical engineering and the ssafety measures
            we had to take to cut metal, weld, and saw. In Tinkercad we were told to build
            home appliances.

            This week we worked on our Rube Goldberg machines and my partners are Geghard, Ayoon, and Joel, we had to make an
            organized model of a pattern to a machine.

          This week we mainly worked on our Rube Goldberg Machines on tinkercad. Our challenge day was floating the most
          amount of weight on a piece of paper. My team made a mutlimotion design replicating
          a organized machine.

          This week we finished our Rube Goldberg Machines Projects made out of cardboard. My teams machine popped the ballon
          on the first try. Our Challenge this week was to ghet a total number of all the urinals and toilets in the school... T_T

            This week we had no challenge because Mr.Poole was sick( we had subs) Our assignment was to make
            an animal prosthetic in Tinkercad and I made a leg prosthetic for a cow.

            This week we dissected a computer, my partner was Parth and basically we both had already built our own pcs
            so seeing the parts such as the GPU, CPU, and other parts wasn't too suprising. However, we both learned about the different parts of a computer different from a PC.

        </p> This week we made the "perfect plane" we wanted to see how how far
        our perfect plane flew from the distance. My partner Ayyon threw the plane, 
        and it was 18 feet
