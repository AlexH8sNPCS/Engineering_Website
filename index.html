            This week I learned about Tinkercad and how to build different objects from
            real life. We learned about mechanical engineering and the ssafety measures
            we had to take to cut metal, weld, and saw. In Tinkercad we were told to build
            home appliances.

            This week we worked on our Rube Goldberg machines and my partners are Geghard, Ayoon, and Joel, we had to make an
            organized model of a pattern to a machine.

          This week we mainly worked on our Rube Goldberg Machines on tinkercad. Our challenge day was floating the most
          amount of weight on a piece of paper. My team made a mutlimotion design replicating
          a organized machine.

          This week we finished our Rube Goldberg Machines Projects made out of cardboard. My teams machine popped the ballon
          on the first try. Our Challenge this week was to ghet a total number of all the urinals and toilets in the school... T_T

            This week we had no challenge because Mr.Poole was sick( we had subs) Our assignment was to make
            an animal prosthetic in Tinkercad and I made a leg prosthetic for a cow.

            This week we dissected a computer, my partner was Parth and basically
            we both had already built our own pcs  so seeing the parts such as the GPU, CPU, and
            other parts wasn't too suprising. However, we both learned about
            the different parts of a computer different from a PC.

        This week we made the "perfect plane" we wanted to see how how far
        our perfect plane flew from the distance. My partner Ayyon threw the plane, 
        and it was 18 feet
        </p>

        10/19/22
        This week was very fun,after planning for a week, Ayyon and Nichlas, along with me.
        We got a coke bottle as our base. We used coke and mentos, to make it go further, along with 
        cardboard wings. In conclusion, it turned out horrible, it was not a success, our rocket 
        did not even 
        </p>

        10/26/22
        We started with a slideshow, Mr. Poole was educating us about
        engineering that related to pollution and the future, we then 
        were tested on what we learned from the slideshow.
        </p>

      For this week we really focused on coding. Mr. Poole grouped our 
      classes with random classmates, for this assignment I was with Druv.
      Mr. Poole taught us how positive and energy works with LEDS, Druv and 
      I learnt to transfer both positive and negative energy by using wires
      (that are connected to the LEDS.
        </p>
        11/09/22(my birthday)
        
         Our class activity was to count how many possible noodles were able
        to fit in an average sized paper. Parth and I were partners for this
        activity, we did a little bit of math, and had a conclusion of 
        478 noodles could fit in a peice of paper. Me and Parth were very off
        with this calculation. The actual answer was 222(Aidens group won)
        </p>

        11/16/22
        This week was almost the same as the begginning of November, although
        this time, we learnt more advanced codes with our LEDs. My 
        partner Druv was a big help, he helped me understand how energy transfer
        works, so I know how to now use positive and negative wires to turn on and 
        off.

        Today we were doing an activity with paper. It was simple,
        find the best design for a paper airplane, and see which groups
        have the furthest distance on the plane. Geghard, Parth, and I 
        were grouped together for this project, we did absolutely horrible, 
        the plane flew about a 10 feet distance.
        </p>
        
        </p>
        11/29/22
        This week, we did an assignment that involved a little math.
        We had to answer the question that said, "If it faster to count
        from one to a million, or write one to a million on paper. There
        were many different opinions on both sides. Although, Parth and I 
        chose that writing would be the best and fastest option. 
        </p>

        12/06/22
        Now for our finals, we have to do make a spaghetti bridge, with 
        the best design and support.  This bridge has to be 2 feet long, 
        and must have 20 less total less noodles. So far this is going by 
        just alright, although Colin is cursing a bit too much(give him an F please)
        </p>
        
        </p>
        12/13/22
        Now have to make mutliple bridges to see which design is best. After
        various attempts we finally found a perfect design for our bridge.
        We are currently building, and we are making a slideshow presentation
        (which is our final grade)
        </p>
        
        </p>
        1/9 This week we learned about buisness engineering, we watched a couple
        shark tank episodes, we then made a product about our product, that we think 
        will be a successfull. My partners, Colin and Parth made a product, that 
        involved a charger. We came out sucessful, with 2 offers, and we accepted
        200k, for 10%.

        2/10 this week my partner and I worked on our project, we designed
        out car out of cardbaord, it's still a work in progres. We also made
        some finshed touches for our google docs, we are very close to finshing
        our car though, overall, a very productive week.
